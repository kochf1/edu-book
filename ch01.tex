\section{New Section}

The Edu-Book Project \cite{koch2024a} is a LaTeX-based framework designed for the efficient creation of structured educational materials. Maintained by Fernando Koch, the project adheres to the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL), version 1.3c or later. Documentation and Getting Started available online:

\begin{verbatim}
https://github.com/kochf1/edu-book
\end{verbatim}

This framework provides tools and configurations, including the edu-slides.sty package, to support the development of educational resources such as figures, diagrams, tables, and structured content. The package emphasizes modularity, ease of integration, and compliance with standard LaTeX distributions.

This section introduces new content that builds upon previous discussions or introduces a fresh topic for exploration. The text in this section provides detailed explanations, insights, or analysis to enrich the reader's comprehension of the subject matter. 

\Figure[caption=Some Figure]{img-1}

This text refers to the content of Figure \texttt{img-1}, which is included to visually represent or supplement the accompanying text. Figures like this are essential for illustrating key concepts, summarizing data, or offering graphical interpretations that aid in understanding complex information.

To configure the directories from which figures can be imported, adjust the following setting:

\begin{verbatim}
image/locations/.initial   = {., ./images}
\end{verbatim}

For troubleshooting or validating the import process, debugging can be enabled with:

\begin{verbatim}
debug/.initial = true
\end{verbatim}


\subsection*{Creating a Diagram}

\Diagram[caption=Some Diagram]{diagram-1}

This text refers to the content of Diagram \texttt{diagram-1}, which has been created to convey structural or procedural information in a graphical format. Diagrams enhance understanding by providing a clear, visual depiction of relationships, processes, or data flows.

Diagrams are generated from TIKZ files (\texttt{tikzpicture} package) and can be located using the following extensions:

\begin{verbatim}
diagram/.initial = {.tikz, .tex}
\end{verbatim}

To specify directories for importing diagrams, configure the following:

\begin{verbatim}
diagram/locations/.initial = {., ./diagrams, ./images}
\end{verbatim}


\subsection*{Creating a Table}

\Table[width=5cm, caption=Some Table]{table-1}

This text refers to the content of Table~\ref{table-1}, which is designed to organize and present data in a structured, easily interpretable format. Tables are crucial for comparing values, highlighting trends, or summarizing information succinctly.

Tables are generated from semi-colon (\texttt{;} separated values (SCSV) files and can be located using the following extensions:

\begin{verbatim}
table/.initial = {.csv}
\end{verbatim}

To configure directories for importing tables, adjust the following setting:

\begin{verbatim}
table/locations/.initial = {., ./tables}
\end{verbatim}
